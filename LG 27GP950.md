User shinyquagsire23 on GitHub did some interesting work on reverse engineering, and we can find some useful information here: https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcutil/issues/100

> ok actually I managed to find the input switching in a service manual of all things (filename 32BL95UW.pdf, search `lg monitor service manual "DDC2AB"`), but it's not via VCPs, it's via the service/factory/manufacturer sidechannel "DDC2AB" (0x50 instead of 0x51)

> So it's DDC2AB Command 0xF4, values 0x90 (HDMI1) 0xD0 (DP) 0xD2 (USB-C). It operates the same as the input switcher as well, so if you're in PBP and the secondary is HDMI1, it will swap the displays if you set the primary to HDMI1.

So, we should generally be looking for the raw DDC message format in 

More importantly, we have an example DDC packet wrapped in the HID protocol format, which will be of great help.

### Observed structure of a DDC request message

08 01 29 03 05 00 03 37518201c975
?? NN VV CC LL ?? XX DDC part

The NN part seems to be an incremental and overflowing counter. (We can see it overflow during software updates), probably used to match requests with responses.

The VV part seems to be a semi-randomly chosen value used throughout a session with the device. (This would supposedly allow multiple programs to access the device simultaneously.)

The CC part seems to be some kind of command information. 03 for a DDC request without response, and 04 for a DDC request with response ?
This is a bit cryptical, as the first byte also seems to be some kind of category or command. Although it is always 0x08 for DDC requests.

The LL part would be the DDC packet data length excepted the I2C address (0x37) when the command is 0x03, and the expected result length when the command is 0x04 ?

The XX part seems to be 0x03 when CC ix 0x03, and 0x0B when CC is 0x04

The DDC part of the message follows the standard DDC format, except that the I2C address is not shifted right (It usually would be 0x37 << 1 = 0x6E)
The signature seems to still consider the shifted value of the I2C address (0x6E, which is somewhat logical but weirdly inconsistent).

### Observed structure of a DDC response message

0f 02 29 00 6e880200c901ffff04067e
SS NN VV    DDC part

In the DDC response, the destination address field is missing, but the source address has the standard value of 0x6E.

The SS part seems to always be the total data length, including the byte itself. Still no idea as to what this value is supposed to be in the other direction.
E.g. We use 0C for the "handshake" that returns some info, and we get a response using 0C, which is exactly 12 bytes. But for the input, it was only 7 bytes.
For DDC messages, 8 bytes is the exact length of the header before the ddc data, so it could be that sometimes.


### Reading data from I2C

It seems a read after a command that doesn't return anything would often return a single byte of 0x10.
I'm assuming the I2C chip has some kind of internal buffer, as it will always fill the requested amount of bytes with either real data or garbage.
Said garbage very often including leftover data from previous reads, in a mostly consistent way.

TODO: Reactive modes (audio/video)

### Observed structure

It seems that requests always start with 0x5343xx and responses always start with 0x52xx where "xx" is the same number in request and response.
It does seem like xx is some kind of command ID, because while it appears weirdly increasing in some cases, some numbers are skipped, and some are duplicated.
The sequence "4544" is found in all request messages (at the end of the non-zero sequence) for some reason.

c7 Seems to be the command that enables the RGB lighting.
cc would likely be the command that request RGB lighting settings. (It at least retrieves the 4 static colors)

#### Analysing a request

This is an example of the request/response for RGB lighting settings.

53 43 cc 01 02 00 00 df 45 44 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
      CC aa bb       KK ?? ??
52 cc 01 0e 04 ff0000 ff00ff 00ffff ffffff 01 94 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   CC aa LL NN R1G1B1 R2G2B2 R3G3B3 R4G4B4 II KK

CC is assumed to be a command ID.
II Seems to indicate which static color is active (1 2 3 or 4 here), or FF if no static color is active
RnGnBn Are the RGB components for color N
NN might be the number of static colors (Because there are 4 and the value here is 4… Could be something else also)
aa & bb are only ever observed to take the values "01 02" and "02 02"
KK Seems to take different values depending on the mode the screen is in. (Could be a checksum ? If so, it will be easy to verify)
   94 => When all colors are left at their default and the static color 1 is selected.
   11 => When the 4th color was modified to orange and on
   97 => When the second color is on
   6a => When the lighting was set to dynamic
   96 => When the third color is on
   91 => When the fourth color is on
LL Seems to be the length of the response data. (Total length minus 4 to account for header and trailer bytes)

e.g. for the status with 4 static lighting modes:
52cc010e04ff0000ff00ff00ffffffffff0194000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
52cc010e04ff0000ff00ff00ffffffffff0297000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
52cc010e04ff0000ff00ff00ffffffffff0396000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
52cc010e04ff0000ff00ff00ffffffffff0491000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
e.g. for dynamic mode
52cc010e04ff0000ff00ff00ffffffffffff6a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

The numbers above seem to correlate the fact that the value is a XOR checksum:

The only part that are changing in the above 4 static lighting messages are "0194", "0297", "0396", "0491"
Going from 01 to 02 is XOR 03 => going from 94 to 97 is XOR 03
Going from 01 to 03 is XOR 02 => going from 94 to 96 is XOR 02
Going from 01 to 04 is XOR 05 => going from 94 to 91 is XOR 05
And we can confirm that 95 XOR FF => 6A (95 being the supposed value if II is 00: 94 XOR 1 = 95)

Now, we could even be able to compute which parts of the message are accounted for…
The only byte having bit 7 set is the second byte of the response message, so it is easy to assume that in that case, the checksum applies to the whole message (except the checksum itself)
Indeed, if computed on the sequence "52cc010e04ff0000ff00ff00ffffffffffff", we get "6A". This checks out.

This seems to apply to (all?) other messages too.
e.g.
52cb01060000000000049 => A0
From
IN  => 5343cb01020000d84544000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
OUT => 52cb01060000000000049a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

So we can conclude that all messages are ended with a XOR checksum of all the bytes in the message.

Knowing this, we can determine (and verify) that the byte preceding 4544 is also a XOR checksum for request messages. (But what is 4544 ?)

In fact, it seems that the LL byte in responses indicate the length of the actual response, excluding the header and the trailer (checksum).

aa seems to be a sub-command kind of thing. It is always 01 when requesting information from the device, and seems to be 02 when requesting a change from the device.
