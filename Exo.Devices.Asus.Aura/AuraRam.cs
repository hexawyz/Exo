			// Detect and validate mapped aura RAM sticks.
			// Previously, RAM sticks would generally be mapped at 0x70â€¥0x77, but from what is said around, this can change depending on availability of the addresses.
			// I know this mapping is at least supported on the Z490 VISION D, as that's what I got in the past, but it might be hard to tell on other motherboards.
			// In fact, after checking, RAM sticks now seem to be mapped from 0x72 onwards.
			// However, something seems to have happened, as there are 8 devices mapped from 0x72 to 0x79 included for only 4 sticks.
			// I'm not sure the Aura addresses that were documented there are still entirely right, though:
			// https://web.archive.org/web/20211010175028/https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/-/wikis/Aura-Controller-Registers
			// * If I request the last accessed address after using RGB Fusion, I get 0x8030, so this must definitely map to something, but what => No actually, that's just the end of color bank 8020.
			// * Trying to request 0x80F9 does not seem to return anything coherent for the I2C/SMBus address? (=> No)
			// In fact, when doing a full dump of the RAM, I found some interesting stuff
			// It seems as if the data at 7FE0 is some kind of chip info. I'm assuming BCD date, and chip ID "6K582"
			// A quick search in google for "6k582" finds some information on Asus motherboards, so that can't be a coincidence.
			// We can probably use this to safeguard the code a bit.
			// As for the 8 mapped devices, it seems, as I suspected, that they are all duplicated for some reason I can't explain.
			// I don't think this was the case in the past, but maybe ? IIRC, for the two sticks I had, those were mapped at 0x72 and 0x74, so it could be a match.
			// In fact, it might be that the ACPI stuff for SMBus is using shifted I2C addresses ðŸ˜‘
			// Then, it would follow that in fact, the devices are mapped to 0x39,0x3A,0x3B and 0x3C. Which would make more senseâ€¦
