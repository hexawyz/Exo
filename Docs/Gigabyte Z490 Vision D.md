Most informations published on these pages can be used, but source code of liquidctl seems to be GPL based, so outside of these public infos, I'm doing the reverse engineering effort again. 😓

# Analysis

## HID APIs

Finding the device was not easy, as despite being listed in device manager, it never showed up in the list of devices reported by RawInput, which is what I initially used for HID discovery.
This is very likely because the device doesn't actually expose any input or output report. It seems to communicate with only output reports.

The device exposes two collections using the vendor-defined HID usage page 0xFF89, as do many devices.
One of those two collections has usage 0x10, while the other has usage 0xCC.

## From Looking at raw USB packets

Capturing via WireShark reveals that the device can either output a feature report containing various informations (name of the chip, etc ?) or receive feature reports, which is mainly whas interests us here.

It doesn't look like we really need the information returned by the device for now. (It is probably mainly used by the RGB Fusion software to identify that the correct device is attached)

From looking at what happens at the USB level, it looks as if the HID Usage 0x10 is never used at all.

RGB Fusion will only ever sent a report 0xCC containing 64 bytes of data (including the report ID).

RGB Fusion will very often send updates to the chip (which can surely be avoided and thus save us some CPU and power), alternating groups of "meaningful packets" with groups of "empty packets".

## Anatomy of a packet

First byte is the report ID. (That's per HID spec, nothing unusual here)

Most of the time, the second byte will take a value between 0x20 and 0x28 included, which **will be correlated** with the value of the third byte.

From what we know, the controller exposes 7 LED controls, which are referenced by "IDs" 0x20 to 0x26 here. There is space for a 8th control here (0x27), but we don't have one, so this is unused.

The byte 0x28 is used to mark the end of a sequence of updates: It seems LEDs are always updated as a consecutive sequence of commands to update each led, then completed by a 0x28 command.
=> In fact, it seems updating a single led can be done as a batch of a single command (plus 0x28ff)

The third byte is usually correlated with the value of the second byte. If second byte is 0x28, third byte must be 0xFF to complete a "transaction". (It seems this will also clear invalid inputs and allow to send a new valid transaction)
For values 0x20 to 0x26, the third byte will be equal to (1 << LedIndex), assuming the second byte is (0x20 + LedIndex). What happens if we set it to other values has not been tested yet.

Later on in the packet, a byte will indicate the effect type:

1. Static color
2. Pulse
3. Flash, single or multiple
4. Color cycle
5. Color cycle ?

As C# Structs, the definition may be clearer.

There are obviously other commands:

0x60 Sent on startup by RGB Fusion 2.0, but unlikely to be required.
0x32 Enable ARGB LED effect on DLED1 or DLED2 or both (mask)
0x34 Seen only once, so I don't know what this is.
0x58/0x59 Seemingly used to send a sequence of colors to ARGB LED strip (Hard to verify but this seems pretty straightforward)

## Reason for the seemingly correlated command and LED mask

Looking only at the raw extracts, and due to the quite naive way RGB Fusion is implemented, it is a bit hard to decrypt how things work, but setting RGB Fusion in "Sync" mode with a mode such as music can help verifying a simple assertion.
It seems that a single command can be used to set all leds a the same time.

e.g. the following sequence could be used to set all leds to white at once
```
cc20FF0000000000000000015A00FFFFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
cc28FF00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

This also gives a reason as to why RGB fusion is always sending "empty packets" between batches of commands.

Similarly to RGB RAM, the chip has an "apply settings" command (0x28 here) to apply the settings pushed with commands 0x20-0x27.
As it turns out, although there is at least one command id per led, any command ID can be used to update *any* LED.
The **actual** protocol used by the chip seems to be a command buffer that is applied upon demand.
As such, every command between 0x20 and 0x27 include, are in fact generic led command buffer slots. These slots **must** be filled in order, and any empty command ends the chain.
These slots are not cleared automatically, thus explaining why RGB Fusion is constantly outputting many empty commands. These could very certainly be optimized away, as clearing the first command before updating it is probably always useless.

Also, it would seem that setting an effect on multiple zones *at once* could produce a different result than setting the same effect on each zone, one at a time.
In fact, from testing, it is possible to conclude that each slot defines an active effect. If a slot is replaced, the effect stops, but the static lighting is preserved.
So, it would not be necessary to overwrite every command before sending an update (assuming there is no other software fighting over the device).
In that case, however, it is quite wise to follow the RGB Fusion methodology and assign a definite slot for each LED.
If we do that, it is possible to only send the commands slots that require an update, which will help reducing CPU usage compared to RGB Fusion. (Less memory copies, less USB latency)

## Sending a stream of colors on a DLED

1. Enable DLED processing using command 0x32 + Bit corresponding to the LED that must be enabled
2. Repeatedly use the 0x58 or 0x59 command to stream the colors on the associated LED
3. Disable DLED processing using command 0x32

Format of a DLED packet:

cc58000039000000f0f0f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f0f0f00000000000
RpCmOf  NbRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBB
cc583900270000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
RpCmOf  NbRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBBRRGGBB

Colors are encoded as a sequence of three bytes
This batch sends (0x39 + 0x27 / 3) = 32 colors in two parts.
The first command sends (0x39 / 3) = 19 colors because that's the maximum possible to send in a single packets. (Don't know if they can be split. Testing would be needed)
The second command sends (0x27 + 3) = 13 colors which completes the previous 19 to make 32.

The command seems to write into some kind of buffer in the chip, with writes represented as an offset + length.
RGB Fusion sends 32 colors, but the "API" seems to permit any number of colors, so I can't tell what is actually possible.

It might be possible to update a single LED in that way, but again, I don't have the hardware for that at the moment.
This would be:
cc580300IxRRGGBB0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Where Ix is the index of the LED * 3 (offset in bytes), and RRGGBB obviously are the RGB color codes.

## Setting the color palette used for color cycling effects (actually most effects can cycle through colors if I understand correctly: the color count byte seems to work almost always)

I found this one by experimenting and got somewhat lucky as it apparently didn't brick anything, but it did erase my color palette at first.
This was thankfully relatively easy to notice, as static color effects were still working.
The number of colors seems to be exactly 7. Any data defined after the 7 RGB values seems to be ignored.

This would set the color cycle to a palette similar to the default one, that I crafted to replace the one I have erased.
cc300000ff0000ffff0000ff0000ffff0000ff000000ff00ff008000ff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

We can probably build one closer to the original by looking to the palette used for "manual" effects in RGB fusion?
This one might be the original palette:
cc300000ff00007fff0000ffff0000ff0000ff00000082004b00d300940000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

## Beat enable command

Found from reverse engineering. The command is a one bit enable/disable:
cc310000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
cc310100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

It seems beat control is triggered via GPIO, so it might be a bit complex to use. From what I understand, this enables triggering flashes from a simple bit switch.
RE indicates that beat mode it would at least require access to CPU IO ports, so we'd either have to rely on the Gigabyte driver or find another way to access these features.
It might be possible to read/write ports using the gigabyte ACPI device exposed over WMI, as in the case of SMB.
Anyway, this mode might not be very useful, as we can control the colors manually, and usb calls might be cheaper than any way of calling SMB/GPIO/whatever.

## Wireshark captures

### Command

Sample commands to batch export the actual SET_FEATURE reports, because it doesn't seem very possible to get this from the UI… 🙁

&"C:\Program Files\Wireshark\tshark.exe" -r 'RGB Fusion Capture.pcapng' -Y """usb.dst == """"1.2.0"""" && usbhid.setup.bRequest == 0x9""" -Tfields -e usb.data_fragment > rgb_fusion_data_1.txt
&"C:\Program Files\Wireshark\tshark.exe" -r '.\RGB Fusion Capture 2.pcapng' -Y """usb.setup.bRequest == 9""" -Tfields -e usb.data_fragment > .\rgb_fusion_data_2.txt

usbhid.setup.bRequest should be 0x9 for SET_REPORT

In the UI, usb.data_fragment can be displayed in the columns, but it is impossible to display or extract *only this data* without truncation.
If necessary, the whole packets can be exported as JSON from the UI and will include usb.data_fragment, but formatted as "BB:YY:TT:EE:00:00"…

Speed = <FadeIn> <FadeOut> <Duration/Sustain?>

My guess is that those are LE UInt16 measuring in some time units (ticks probably, but what is the frequency ?)
Not sure yet if the FadeIn & FadeOut are proportional to EffectDuration, but it is possible to estimate the clock frequency by setting FadeIn & FadeOut to zero, then measuring time between two color changes.
With rough measuring value of around 0x10B8 (4280) gives approximately 4 seconds for a transition from dark to bright. (so 8 sec total)
It might still be a bit under 4sec though. Will do additional measuring later.

It seems the effect is as such:

1 - Going from 100% to 0% brightness in FadeOut Ticks
2 - Staying at 0% for Duration ticks
3 - Going from 0% to 100% brightness in FadeIn Ticks
4 - Staying at 100% for Duration ticks

6400 6400 seems awfully like the two repeated bytes in Pulse mode
Setting first number to zero completely disables the effect, but not second number.
Probably <LightDuration> <DarkDuration> or something like that, but seems kinda proportional ?
Setting second number to zero + Multiple pulses seems to merge all the pulses into one.

07 might be the number of colors ?
=> It would seem so
1 Red
2 Yellow
3 Green Yellow
4 Green
5 Blue
6 Violet
7 Magenta~Pink
(8 Black)
Going further seems to produce weird results. (Possibly some kind of buffer overflow in the chip's firmware)
However, one can reduce the number of colors of the cycle, provided they want a subset of the preprogrammed color cycle.


Speeds from low to high (6 levels in RGB fusion)
S0 7805 b004
S1 7e04 1a04
S2 5203 ee02
S3 f802 9402
S4 2602 c201
S5 cc01 6801

Setting the second value to 0 disables the fading between colors

From previous measurements, clock resolution for LED updates might be somewhere between 1070 and 1100 Hz.

Number 1 seems to be duration of a color
Number 2 seems to be duration of the color transition, **included inside** Number 1

N2 must be ≤ N1 for correct operation

N2 = 0 => Immediate transition

I suspect the 0xFF at the position where Blue appears in other modes is a leftover from RGB Fusion 2.0 Software which defaults to the blue color on this MB.


#### Digital A (Would be same for most digital effects I guess, but this one seems pretty straightforward)

While not having ARGB LEDs, it seems to be pretty clear what this does.
Software is continually sending update commands to DLED_1 to achieve the effect. (The CPU usage 🙁)

This one is interesting: It seems to indicate that the effect should be enabled.
DLED1 = 01
DLED2 = 02
And it seems to be a mask, so effect can be enabled on both LEDs at the same time !

For some reasons, the software assigns the color to the LED, but this is not done with an effect ID… Might be unnecessary ?

cc28ff00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Now the software sends packets. Those seem to be grouped by two.
Note that 58 is DLED1 and 59 is DLED2.
