# Razer Mamba Chroma

The device is part of the ones incompatible with Synapse 3, however, from a quick glance at Wireshark, it uses the same protocol as the enwer DeathAdder V2 Pro.
Writing the code for that device should be just an extension of the same code.

# Device features

* 7 Buttons
* ARGB lighting (like all Chroma devices?)
* 16000 DPI (configurable)
* Wired or wireless through a dedicated dock (also acting as a dongle)
* Battery (obviously)
* Onboard memory for some settings such as lighting effects (To be investigated)

## Protocol

The mouse seem to e based on a older version of the protocol (Likely also why it is not compatible with Synapse 3. That and because they would have needed to write another set of kernel drivers I guess)
Many functions work identically to the newer protocol, but that does not include lighting.

Synapse seems to use IDs `1f` and `3f` to communicate with the device, whereas DeathAdder V2 Pro would use `08` and `1f`.
Despite this, my hastily adapted POC with the same code and IDs as for DeathAdder V2 Pro seemed to work fine out of the box.

Exact meaning of those Razer IDs remains a mysteryâ€¦

### Basic lighting stuff

The lighting on this feature uses category code `03` instead of `0f` on the newer devices (`0f` seems like it might do something else on this mouse though)

#### Brightness

00 3f 000000 03 03 03 01 05 ff 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f800

This one command sets the brightness. While synapse 2.0 does not do it, testing shows that the brightness can actually be read back (unlike newer devices ?)

The meaning of the two parameters `01` and `05` is unknown.
I suspected `01` could indicate persistence, but there doesn't seem to be an equivalent for lighting (always persisted?), so this could as well be the wired vs wireless flag.

#### Built-in effects

Exact details unclear, but there seem to be at least two commands to set lighting effects. (Probably to address the multiple lighting zones)
In my tests, I used `0a` (as it was the one that popped of the most when playing with Synapse) and it updated the whole mouse with the effect I picked.

Also, parameters are specific to each effect, and commands need to be sent exactly (no invalid data length with zero padding) for them to work.
Effect IDs are also not the same as for newer devices.

##### Command `0A`

`01` Wave:

00 3f 000000 02 03 0a 01 02 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000800

Wave has one extra parameter which is the direction. Can be `01` or `02` (represented by upward and downward arrows in Synapse)

`02` Reactive:

00 3f 000000 05 03 0a 02 03 00ffff 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d00

This effect has a speed parameter. `01` is slow, `03` is mid, and `04` is fast. (From the three settings exposed in Synapse)

`03` Breathing:

00 3f 000000 08 03 0a 03 02 00ffff ff00ff 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Breathing has a color count parameter. (I didn't pay attention at the time, but `03` might be the random colors setting, instead of zero)

`04` Color cycle:

00 3f 000000 01 03 0a 04 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c00

This effect has no parameter at all.

`05` Dynamic ???:

00 3f 000000 02 03 0a 05 00 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e00

Not entirely certain but this one appeared when playing with the Chroma configurator. (Interleaved with `0C` commands)

`06` Static:

00 3f 000000 04 03 0a 06 00ffff 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b00

Static has only three RGB bytes as a parameter.

##### Command `01`

00 3f 000000 05 03 01 00 03 00ffff 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000400

#### Dynamic colors

Dynamic colors are set by the `0C` command. Details not investigated, but the payload is 47 bytes, which can only hold 15 colors. (7 + 7 + 1 ? I didn't count the number of leds but that could be it)

00 3f 000000 2f 03 0c 00 0e 00ff00 00ff00 00ff00 00ff00 00ff00 00ff00 00ff00 00ff00 00ff00 00ff00 00ff00 00ff00 00ff00 00ff00 00ff00 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d100


### DPI

This one command seems to obviously sets the mouse DPI presets:

00 3f 000000 26 04 03 01 00 05 00 0320 0320 000000 0708 0708 000000 1194 1194 000000 2328 2328 000000 3e80 3e80 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002500

It seems to be different than the one from newer devices, but is assigns multiple profiles at once too. (Trying to use the newer command will fail)

The command to read/write the current DPI level is however the same. (`05`)
