	/// <summary>Gets the configuration key used to load the configuration.</summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// The configuration key is used to uniquely identify the device in the configuration, and appropriately save and restore its settings.
	/// It will generally default to the device path, but a different key such as a serial number, can be used to identify a device even when connected to a different port.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The returned key MUST be unique, deterministic, and no two driver instances must share the same key.
	/// Failure to comply to this rule will lead to various problems.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// As a default rule, all drivers should prefix their configuration key with a string uniquely identifying the driver in order to avoid name collisions.
	/// No need to be over-specific by having the exact driver type name, as it could change after a refactoring. A quick identifyiong key would be enough.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// TODO: We may need a mechanism to handle devices without a serial number than can frequently move ports but generally not have more than one instance.
	/// e.g. it is unusual to have two identical keyboards connected at the same time, but it should also workâ€¦
	/// It could also be desirable to allow settings to be ported across similar hardware configuration. e.g. Same monitor model, same keyboard model, but different devices because different office.
	/// Maybe in that case, having two key mechanisms could be helpful. e.g. a generic less-unique key and an globally unique key (SN# or device path)
	/// Maybe the non-unique key would be used preferably, but the unique key would be used to differentiate two instances. (e.g. "Keyboard Brand X #1" and "Keyboard Brand X #2")
